note = Note.create!(title: "Punctuation Marks",
content: "The less punctuation marks, taken in isolation, convey meaning or
expression and the more they constitute the opposite pole in language
to names, the more each of them acquires a definitive physiognomic
status of its own, an expression of its own, which cannot be separated
from its syntactic function but is by no means exhausted by it. When
the hero of Gottfried Keller's novel Der grune Heinrich was asked
about the German capital letter P, he exclaimed, 'That's Pumpernickel!
'' That experience is certainly true of the figures of punctuation.
An exclamation point looks like an index finger raised in warning; a
question mark looks like a flashing light or the blink of an eye. A
colon, says Karl Kraus, opens its mouth wide: woe to the writer who
does not fill it with something nourishing. Visually, the semicolon
looks like a drooping moustache; I am even more aware of its gamey
taste. With self-satisfied peasant cunning, German quotation marks
(<< >>) lick their lips.
All of them are traffic signals; in the last analysis, traffic signals
were modeled on them. Exclamation points are red, colons green,
dashes call a halt. But the [Stefan] George Circle was wrong in mistaking
them for marks of communication because of this. On the contrary,
they are marks of oral delivery; instead of diligently serving the
interplay between language and the reader, they serve, hieroglyphically,
an interplay that takes place in the interior of language, along
its own pathways. Hence it is superfluous to omit them as being superfluous:
then they simply hide. Every text, even the most densely
woven, cites them of its own accord-friendly spirits whose bodiless
presence nourishes the body of language.",

  content: "Going electronic. Radical or so-called innovative literary writing faces (& that means faces up to) the facts of life in the digital age. If you have been committed to foregrounding the processes by which language works, to the unsettling & detonation of an established medium — what then? How simpatico is this potential cyberworld as a staging area & as a reading environment? 1 

Raw material: if you use language in its ‘unfinished’ (less thoroughly socialized) state or at a molecular level, the project lends itself to the jammed, disjunctive situations of the screen with its striking dispersions or overlaps. Densities of significance can become visibly spatial, programmatically animated or varying or self-mistranslating. So at least the electronic realm can show the dependence of sense & meaning on technical mechanics, even if not on an encompassing social system of language. Can we lay out — sometimes keeping them present as separate & navigable layers — the alternative choices & building blocks of discourse as an array of hypermediated readymades, with the bleed-throughs of palimpsest-like sense solicited by the reading process?

Note.create!(title: "Manifesto In A Clear Language",
  content: "If I believe neither in Evil nor in Good, if I feel such a strong inclination to destroy, if there is nothing in the order of principles to which I can reasonably accede, the underlying reason is in my flesh.

  I destroy because for me everything that proceeds from reason is untrustworthy.I believe only in the evidence of what stirs my marrow, not in the evidence of what addresses itself to my reason. I have found levels in the realm of the nerve.

  I now feel capable of evaluating the evidence. There is for me an evidence in the realm of pure flesh which has nothing to do with the evidence of reason. The eternal conflict between reason and the heart is decided in my very flesh, but in my flesh irrigated by nerves. In the realm of the affective imponderable, the image provided by my nerves takes the form of the highest intellectuality, which I refuse to strip of its quality of intellectuality. And so it is that I watch the formation of a concept which carries within it the actual fulguration of things, a concept which arrives upon me with a sound of creation. No image satisfies me unless it is at the same time Knowledge, unless it carries with it its substance as well as its lucidity. My mind, exausted by discursive reason, wants to be caught up in the wheels of a new, an absolute gravitation. For me it is like a supreme reorganization in which only the laws of illogic participate, and in which there triumphs the discovery of a new Meaning. This Meaning which has been lost in the disorder of drugs and which presents the appearance of a profound intelligence to the contradictory phantasms of the sleep. This Meaning is a victory of the mind over itself, and although it is irreducible by reason, it exists, but only inside the mind. It is order, it is intelligence, it is the signification of chaos. But it does not accept this chaos as such, it interprets it, and because it interprets it, it loses it. It is the logic of illogic. And this is all one can say. My lucid unreason is not afraid of chaos.

  I renounce nothing of that which is the Mind. I want only to transport my mind elsewhere with its laws and organs. I do not surrender myself to the sexual mechanism of the mind, but on the contrary within this mechanism I seek to isolate those discoveries which lucid reason does not provide. I surrender to the fever of dreams, but only in order to derive from them new laws. I seek multiplication, subtlety, the intellectual eye in delirium, not rash vaticination. There is a knife which I do not forget.

  But it is a knife which is halfway into dreams, which I keep inside myself, which I do not allow to come to the frontier of the lucid senses.

  That which belongs to the realm of the image is irreducible by reason and must remain within the image or be annihilated.

  Nevertheless, there is a reason in images, there are images which are clearer in the world of image-filled vitality.

  There is in the immediate teeming of the mind a multiform and dazzling insinuation of animals. This insensible and thinking dust is organized according to laws which it derives from within itself, outside the domain of clear reason or of thwarted consciousness or reason.

  In the exalted realm of images, illusion properly speaking, or material error, does not exist, much less the illusion of knowledge: but this is all the more reason why the meaning of a new knowledge can and must descend into the reality of life.

  The truth of life lies in the impulsiveness of matter. The mind of man has been poisoned by concepts. Do not ask him to be content, ask him only to be calm, to believe that he has found his place. But only the madman is really calm.",

Note.create!(title: "How I Became Charming, Likeable And Delightful",
  content: "I sleep very late. I commit suicide at 65%. My life is very cheap, it's only 30% of life for me. My life has 30% of life. It lacks arms, strings and a few buttons. 5% is devoted to a state of semi-lucid stupor accompanied by anaemic crackling. This 5% is called DADA. So life is cheap. Death is a bit more expensive. But life is charming and death is equally charming. 
A few days ago I was at a meeting of imbeciles. There were a lot of people there. Everyone was charming. Tristan Tzara, a small, absurd and insignificant individual was giving a lecture on the art of becoming charming. He was charming, at that. Everyone is charming. And witty. It's delightful, isn't it? Everyone is delightful, at that. 9 degrees below zero. It's charming, isn't it? No, it isn't charming. God isn't up to it. He isn't even in the directory. But even so he's charming. 
Ambassadors, poets, counts, princes, musicians, journalists, actors, writers, diplomats, directors, dressmakers, socialists, princesses and baronesses are charming. 
You're all of you charming, very subtle, witty and delightful. Tristan Tzara says to you: he's quite willing to do something else, but he prefers to remain an idiot, a practical joker and a hoaxer. Be sincere for a moment: what I've just said to you - is it charming or idiotic? There are some people (journalists, lawyers, amateurs, philosophers) who even think that business, marriages, visits, wars, various conferences, limited companies, politics, accidents, dance halls, economic crises, fits of hysterics, are variations of dada. 
Not being an imperialist, I don't share their opinion. I believe rather, that dada is only a divinity of the second order, which must quite simply be placed beside the other forms of the new mechanism of the religions of the interregnum. 
Is simplicity simple, or dada? 
I consider myself rather likeable.",

Note.create!(title: "manifeste du surréalisme"
  content: "La réalité est la base de tout grand ait. Sans elle pas de vie, pas de substance. La réalité, c'est le sol sous nos pieds et le ciel sur notie tête.

Tout ce que l'artiste crée a son point de départ dans la nature. Les cubistes, à leurs débuts, s'en rendirent bien compte : aussi humbles que les plus purs primitifs, ils s'abaissèrent profondément jusqu'à l'objet le plus simple, le plus dénué de valeur, et allèrent jusqu'à coller sur le tableau un morceau de papier peint, dans toute sa réalité.

Cette transposition de la réalité dans un plan supérieur (artistique) constitue le Surréalisme.

Le surréalisme est une conception qu'anima Guillaume Apollinaire. En examinant son œuvre poétique, nous y trouvons les mêmes éléments que chez les premiers cubistes : les mots de la vie quotidienne ont pour lui « une magie étrange », et c'est avec eux, avec la matière première du langage, qu'il travaillait. Max Jacob raconte qu'un jour, Apollinaire nota simplement des phrases et des mots entendus dans la rue, et en fit un poème.

Seulement avec ce matériel élémentaire, il forma des images poétiques. L'image est aujourd'hui le critère de la bonne poésie. La rapidité d'association entre la première impression et la dernière expression fait la qualité de l'image.

Le premier poète au monde constata : « Le ciel est bleu ». Plus tard, un autre trouva : « Tes yeux sont bleus comme le ciel ». Longtemps après, on se hasarda à dire : « Tu as du ciel dans les yeux ». Un moderne s'écriera : « Tes yeux de ciel ! ». Les plus belles images sont celles qui rapprochent des éléments de la réalité éloignés les uns des autres le plus directement et le plus rapidement possible.

Ainsi, l'image est devenue l'attribut le plus apprécié de la poésie moderne. Jusqu'au début du XX e siècle, c'était Y oreil qui décidait de la qualité d'une poésie : rythme, sonorité, cadence, allitération, rime : tout pour l'oreille. Depuis une vingtaine d'années, Y œil prend sa revanche. C'est le siècle du film. Nous communiquons davantage par des signes visuels. Et c'est la rapidité qui fait aujourd'hui la qualité.

L art est une émanation de la vie et de l'organisme de l'homme. Le surréalisme, expression de notre époque, tient compte des symp-

tomes qui la caiactéxisent : il est direct, intensif, et il repousse les arts qui s'appuient sur des notions abstraites et de seconde main : logique, esthétique, effets de grammaire, jeux de mots.

Le surréalisme ne se contente pas d'être le moyen d'expression d'un gToupe ou d'un pays : il sera international, il absorbera tous les ismes qui partagent l'Europe, et recueillera les éléments vitaux de chacun.

Le surréalisme est un vaste mouvement de l'époque. Il signifie la santé, et repoussera aisément les tendances de décomposition et de morbidité qui surgissent partout où quelque chose se construit.

L'art de divertissement, l'art des ballets et du music-hall, l'art curieux, l'art pittoresque, l'art à base d'exotisme et d'érotisme, l'art étrange, l'art inquiet, l'art égoïste, l'art frivole et décadent auront bientôt cessé d'amuser une génération qui, après la guerre, avait besoin d'oublier.

Et cette contrefaçon du surréalisme, que quelques ex-dadas ont inventée pour continuer à épater les bourgeois, sera vite mise hors de la circulation :

Ils affirment la « toute-puissance du rêve » et font de Freud une muse nouvelle. Que le docteur Freud se serve du rêve pour guérir des troubles trop terrestres, fort bien ! Mais de là à faire de sa doctrine une application dans le monde poétique, n'est-ce pas confondre art et psychiatrie ?

Leur « mécanisme psychique basé sur le rêve et le jeu désintéressé de la pensée » ne sera jamais assez puissant pour ruiner notre organisme physique qui nous enseigne que la réalité a toujours raison, que la vie est plus vraie que la pensée.

Notre surréalisme retrouve la nature, l'émotion première de l'homme, et va, avec un matériel artistique complètement neuf, vers une construction, vers une volonté."
